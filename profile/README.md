## Overview 
This is my attempt to fit the Cat Doorbell onto a single microcontroller, namely the [ESP32-S3-EYE (v2.2)](https://github.com/espressif/esp-who/blob/master/docs/en/get-started/ESP32-S3-EYE_Getting_Started_Guide.md). Version 3 aimed to streamline the hardware requirements by utilizing a single ESP32-based microcontroller, the ESP32-S3-EYE. Initially, replicating the functionality of the previous version proved complex, particularly in identifying cat meows via sound, which required creating a TensorFlow Lite modelâ€”a challenging task taking weeks to accomplish.

Once a meow identification model was developed, integrating it with the camera-based cat identification process was problematic. Ultimately, the solution shifted to solely relying on image identification to detect cats. The updated version constantly scans for cat faces and sends a REST API message, resulting in an SMS notification. Area illumination is managed by a separate microcontroller.
