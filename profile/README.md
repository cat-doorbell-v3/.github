## Overview 
This is my attempt to fit the Cat Doorbell onto a single microcontroller, namely the [ESP32-S3-EYE (v2.2)](https://github.com/espressif/esp-who/blob/master/docs/en/get-started/ESP32-S3-EYE_Getting_Started_Guide.md). My efforts so far have been largely based on Tensorflow.  But it is proving to be a steep learning curve for microcontroller implementations.
